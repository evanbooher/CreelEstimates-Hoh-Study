# BSS effort-bias (`b`) temporal-stability analysis

Branch: `explore/bss-effort-bias-stability` only. Unrelated to, and does not
depend on, `chore/multi-fishery-trip-summary` (the PST/consultant deliverable
branch) -- some code patterns below were transcribed from that branch's
`analysis/pst/02_ingest/multi_fishery_creel_summary.R` for reference, but
nothing here imports or merges from it.

Built for a DFW/tribal technical-staff meeting deciding how to use historical
years of data for the bias-correction component of the freshwater creel
Bayesian State-Space (BSS) estimation framework, for the Stillaguamish,
Snohomish, and (regional-context) Skagit basins.

## What "the bias term" is

In the BSS Stan model (`vector<lower=0>[G] b`, prior `lognormal(0,
value_lognormal_sigma_b)`, prior median 1 = "no bias"), `b` is used
POSITIONALLY, not by angler type:

- `b[1]` -- bias in the **vehicle** index count (road counts of cars vs. the
  true angler-vehicle relationship)
- `b[2]` -- bias in the **trailer** index count

This is the "effort bias term" the meeting is about. It is a **different**
parameter from `p_TI` / `TI_expan`, the census:index tie-in spatial-coverage
ratio (`prep_dwg_census_expan.R` calls that "the bias parameter/expansion
factor" in its own comments) -- the two sit adjacent in the code and in the
same likelihood line, but this analysis is about `b` specifically, per an
explicit scoping decision. `p_TI` is tracked in the comparability table
(Phase 3) because a `p_TI` change year-to-year would distort `b`, not because
`p_TI` itself is the thing being compared.

`b` is confounded with `R_V` (vehicles-per-angler) in the vehicle-count
likelihood and is only pinned down by the interview-side binomial on
`V_A`/`A_A`. A fishery-year with few/no vehicle-count interviews will
produce a `b` posterior that mostly reflects its prior, not its data --
every output table carries a `prior_contraction` / `informed_flag` column
for exactly this reason. Read it before trusting a point estimate.

## Stan model used

**`BSS_creel_model_02_2021-01-22_ppc.stan`**, standardized across every
fishery-year -- this is the file confirmed to be in current production use.
`b`'s declaration/prior/likelihood placement is identical across all four
model files in `stan_models/` (verified directly against the `_ppc` file's
source), so this choice doesn't change what `b` means. It does declare `O`
as `matrix[D,S]` (2-D), matching `prep_inputs_bss()`'s unmodified output --
compatible. `BSS_creel_model_02_2024-07-24.stan` is excluded from this
analysis entirely: it declares `O` as `real O[D,S,G]` (3-D), a hard
dimension mismatch against `prep_inputs_bss()`, not a subtle bug -- don't
point this pipeline at it without first updating `prep_inputs_bss()` itself.

The `_ppc` variant carries a `*_rep` generated-quantities block (still
computed during sampling regardless of `pars=`, so somewhat slower
per-iteration than the non-`_ppc` files) and has no compiled `.rds` cache in
`stan_models/` yet -- expect a one-time ~1-3 min recompile on the first fit.

The full prior vector is copied verbatim from `template_scripts/fw_creel.Rmd`
and held constant across every fishery-year (see `BSS_PRIORS` in
`01_fit_bss_bias.R`) -- changing `value_lognormal_sigma_b` between years
would make the whole comparison meaningless.

## Catch-group selection

`b` is fit once per fishery-year, against a **fixed target catch group keyed
off the fishery name** -- not pooled total salmon, not derived from observed
species in the data. Per explicit direction, `fishery_target_catch_group()`
in `01_fit_bss_bias.R` applies, in order:

| Fishery name contains | Target catch group (`est_cg`) |
|---|---|
| `Chinook` | `Chinook_Adult_AD_Kept` |
| `fall salmon`, or basin = Stillaguamish (its "salmon and gamefish" naming never contains "fall salmon" literally) | `Coho_Adult_AD\|UM_Kept` |
| `sockeye` | `Sockeye_Adult_AD\|UM_Kept` |

Fate is **harvest only** (`Kept`) for every rule -- a deliberate narrowing
from an earlier pooled-total design that used `Kept|Released` on the
reasoning that BSS catch is total encounters, not harvest. Chinook is
`AD`-only (hatchery-marked) while Coho/Sockeye are `AD|UM` (both marks) --
intentional given wild/unmarked Chinook are typically release-only under
regulation in these fisheries. A fishery name matching none of these rules
hard-stops the whole run (`cli_abort`, not a per-fishery skip) rather than
silently proceeding with no catch group -- surfacing a naming gap
immediately. This matters for `b` specifically (not just for catch) because
the interview rows feeding `IntA`/`V_A`/`T_A` are filtered by `est_cg`
upstream of `prep_inputs_bss()`. The chosen `est_cg` string is recorded in
every output row (`chosen_est_cg` / `est_cg` columns).

## Pipeline

Run in order:

1. **`00_discover_fisheries.R`** -- no VPN, no DB, no Stan. Pulls the full
   historical fishery-name registry from the public "WDFW Creel Fishery
   Manager" dataset (`data.wa.gov`, Socrata id `vkjc-s5u8`), filters to
   Skagit/Snohomish/Stillaguamish (+ adjacent systems), writes
   `outputs/fishery_discovery_target.csv`. **Review this file by hand** and
   edit its `include_in_run` column before step 2.

   Also worth 5 minutes: browse `https://data.wa.gov/browse?q=creel` --
   `vkjc-s5u8` is a fishery *registry*; a sibling dataset with actual
   effort/interview-level data may exist and could feed step 2 directly
   without a DB pull at all. See the "public-data path" note below.

1b. **`00b_capture_fishery_params.R`** -- **VPN required; run once, commit the
   result. Participants do not run this.** Captures the one remaining
   VPN-only parameter -- the estimation window (`resolve_dates()` reads
   `creelutils::fishery_lut()`, which has no `data.wa.gov` equivalent) --
   into `lookup/fishery_params.csv`. Step 2 reads that file whenever
   `DATA_SOURCE` is `"external"`, which is what makes a no-VPN run possible.

   It records the *resolved* window, not the raw lookup-table columns, on
   purpose: `resolve_dates()` computes `resolved_end = min(fishery_end_date,
   Sys.Date() - 1)`, so for an **in-season** fishery the window depends on
   what day the script runs. Pinning it in a committed file makes two runs on
   different days comparable -- something the live lookup cannot guarantee,
   VPN or not.

**Every column of the variability table** is defined in
[`T2_DATA_DICTIONARY.md`](T2_DATA_DICTIONARY.md) -- what each field is, how it
is calculated, and what it tells you, with a worked Snohomish example
throughout. Read it before quoting a tau, an I-squared or a prediction interval
to anyone.

**Data issues found along the way** are recorded in
[`DATA_ISSUES.md`](DATA_ISSUES.md) — findings about the underlying creel data
rather than this analysis's code. The first one, missing closure records,
affects the creel estimates themselves and not just this work.

1c. **`00c_probe_location_lut.R`** -- **VPN required; run once, commit the
   result. Participants do not run this.** Finds the fishery/location lookup
   table in the internal database and captures the rows for the target
   fishery-years into `lookup/fishery_location_lut.csv`, so the "what changed
   about this fishery's location definition across years" comparison runs on
   the no-VPN path like everything else.

   It probes rather than hard-coding a table name: `fishery_location_lut` is
   referenced nowhere in this repo and `creelutils` exposes no accessor for
   it, so the script searches `information_schema` for tables whose *column
   signature* fits (something fishery-shaped plus something section- or
   location-shaped), scores them, and stops with the evidence printed rather
   than guessing when the top candidates tie. Set `LUT_TABLE` at the top to
   skip the search once the table is known.

1d. **`fishery_data.R`** -- not a step; the shared data layer. Everything
   between "a fishery name" and "the raw dwg tables for its estimation
   window": `DATA_SOURCE`, the single DB connection, the captured-window
   lookup, date normalisation, and a disk cache of each fetch. Sourced by
   step 2 and by `02b`, so the fits and the coverage tables cannot disagree
   about which window a fishery-year used.

2. **`01_fit_bss_bias.R`** -- the main driver. For each included
   fishery-year: fetch data, prep BSS inputs, fit the Stan model, extract
   `b`. Writes a **comparability row per fishery-year BEFORE fitting**, so
   step 3 doesn't need any fit to have succeeded. Everything is written
   incrementally (append-as-you-go) so an interrupted overnight run doesn't
   lose completed fishery-years.

3. **`02_build_comparability_table.R`** -- no MCMC required, only needs step
   2 to have run its data-prep stage for at least one fishery. Produces the
   standalone comparability table (date windows, CRC areas, `p_TI`, count
   availability, an explicit `comparability_tier` per fishery-year). **This
   table alone is a legitimate meeting deliverable** even with zero
   completed fits -- see "Go/no-go" below.

4. **`03_plot_b_series.R`** -- the top-priority deliverable. Six figures;
   Figure 1 + 2 composite is the actual slide. Needs `dataviz`-skill-guided
   design choices already baked in (see the script's header for how a
   web/CSS-oriented skill was adapted to static R/ggplot output).

5. **`04_candidate_options.R`** -- the four candidate bias-correction options
   (mean / most-recent / precision-weighted / hierarchical-shrinkage) per
   fishery-series. Re-run `03_plot_b_series.R` after this to get Figure 6
   (options overlaid on the series).

## Public-data path -- confirmed working, VPN not required

**Checked locally (VPN off):** `creelutils::fetch_data(fishery_name = "Skagit
fall salmon 2024", data_source = "external")` is the public/`data.wa.gov`
path, and it returns BSS-grade data. `dwg$effort` (5247x25) and `dwg$catch`
(964x11) pass the full column checklist in `01_fit_bss_bias.R`'s header
(including `species`/`life_stage`/`fin_mark`/`fate` on `catch`). `dwg$interview`
(1811x39) has every required raw column except `fishing_time_total` /
`person_count_final`, which are computed downstream from columns that ARE
present (`fishing_start_time`/`fishing_end_time`, `angler_count`/
`total_group_count`) -- not a gap.

`dwg$ll`'s `centroid_lat`/`centroid_lon` and `dwg$fishery_manager`'s
`p_census_bank`/`p_census_boat` were not independently re-verified against
the public path, but per direct confirmation the latter is moot for `b`
either way: `p_census_bank`/`boat` feed the `p_TI`/census-tie-in spatial-
coverage correction (a defunct-in-practice, DIFFERENT parameter -- see "What
'the bias term' is" above), not `b`'s identification.

`DATA_SOURCE` in `01_fit_bss_bias.R` therefore **defaults to `"external"`**.
That is a deliberate choice, not a fallback: it makes the entire analysis
reproducible from this repo plus plain internet access, with no VPN and no
WDFW database credentials. Meeting participants (DFW and tribal technical
staff) can clone the branch and re-run every step start to finish and get
the same numbers -- the difference between sharing results and sharing an
analysis. `"internal"` stays available for DB-only needs.

## Same-day feasibility -- read this before starting a full historical run

**No cached BSS posterior fits exist anywhere in this repo for these three
basins** (only rstan's compiled-model `.rds` caches in `stan_models/`, not
posterior draws). A full historical run -- 3 basins x N years x up to 4
concurrent named Skagit fisheries, each a fresh MCMC fit -- is unlikely to
finish before the meeting. Triage in this order:

- **T0 (15 min, do this first):** search your own machine / network drives /
  prior project folders for any saved `stanfit` `.rds` from a past BSS run of
  these fisheries. If any turn up, `get_bss_bias()` extracts `b` from them in
  seconds and steps 3-5 complete immediately for those years.
- **T1 (30 min):** the public-data-path check above -- DONE, confirmed
  working (`data_source = "external"`); not on this run's critical path
  since VPN is available, but ruled out as a blocker either way.
- **T2 (30-60 min):** run ONE fishery-year (suggest `"Skagit fall salmon
  2024"`) end-to-end at `FIT_CONFIG_NAME <- "smoke"` in `01_fit_bss_bias.R`
  to prove the pipeline, then re-run the SAME fishery at `"quick"` and time
  it. That number x the fishery-year count is your actual budget. **If a
  single `quick` fit exceeds ~45 minutes, stop the full historical run and
  go straight to T3 step 1 only** -- put remaining time into the
  comparability table and plots instead.
- **T3:** prioritized subset, in order, stopping when time runs out:
  1. Most recent 3 years x 3 basins, primary fishery only (Skagit fall
     salmon, Snohomish fall salmon, Stillaguamish salmon-and-gamefish) -- 9
     fits. Minimum viable story.
  2. Skagit's other named fisheries (spring Chinook upper/lower, summer
     sockeye), most recent 2 years -- 6 fits. This is what makes the
     "separate series per named fishery" point concrete.
  3. Backfill earlier years, most-recent-first, until out of time.
- **T4:** kick off remaining fits overnight in a detached R session; steps
  3-5 re-run cleanly against whatever's in `outputs/` at 7am, no edits needed.

### Go/no-go -- what ships even in the worst case

| Tier | Needs | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| Floor | Steps 1 + 3 only, **no fits** | The comparability table alone -- a legitimate deliverable: it defines which fishery-years are even comparable, which the group has to agree on before any `b` number matters |
| Minimum viable | T3 step 1 (~9 fits) | + Figure 1 (3-yr series, 3 basins) + Figure 3 + options (a)/(b) |
| Target | T3 steps 1-2 (~15 fits) | + Skagit's concurrent tracks + Figures 2/4/5 + all four options with I²/tau² |
| Stretch | Full backfill | + complete series + a scoped (d2) in-model hierarchical `b` proposal |

Frame the meeting outcome accordingly: **the defensible ask for tomorrow is
agreement on the *rule* (which option) and the *comparability criteria*,
with numbers backfilled at production fit quality afterward.**

## Net-new vs. reused

| | |
|---|---|
| Reused unchanged | `resolve_dates.R`, `prep_days.R`, `prep_dwg_interview_fishing_time.R`, `prep_dwg_interview_angler_types.R`, `prep_dwg_interview_catch.R`, `prep_dwg_effort_index.R`, `prep_dwg_effort_census.R`, `prep_dwg_census_expan.R`, `prep_inputs_bss.R` |

| Net-new function | `R_functions/get_bss_bias.R` -- extracts `b[1]`/`b[2]` posterior summaries from a stanfit |
| Net-new function | `R_functions/drop_na_bss_inputs.R` -- drops NA rows from prep_inputs_bss()'s observation-level Stan inputs before fitting (Stan hard-errors on any NA in `data`); logs what it dropped per fishery-year to `bss_b_na_drops.csv` |
| Net-new scripts | everything in `analysis/bss_bias/` |
| Transcribed patterns (not imports) | `skip_fishery()`/`run_stage()` condition-class error handling, the run ledger, `resolve_study_design()`, `preflight_fishery()` -- from `chore/multi-fishery-trip-summary`'s `multi_fishery_creel_summary.R`, read-only reference |
| Explicitly deferred | (d2), an in-model hierarchical re-specification of `b` itself across years -- flagged as a principled follow-on, not attempted here |

## Outputs (`analysis/bss_bias/outputs/`)

Tracked in git (small, and they ARE the deliverable): all `.csv`, `.html`,
`figures/`, `b_draws/`. Gitignored (large): `fits/` (full stanfit objects,
only written if `SAVE_FITS <- TRUE`).
